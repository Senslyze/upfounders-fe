  "description": "Smatbot is a leading AI chatbot solution provider, specializing in WhatsApp chatbots. We have developed a variety of use cases on top of the WhatsApp Business API, including end-to-end e-commerce flows, ticket booking, food delivery, logistics with delivery partner integration, POD validation, and more. We also developed a feature where your live agents can access the live chats from their WhatsApp directly without the need to log into the agent dashboard. Our chatbot is already integrated with GPT and other open-source LLMs, and we can train these LLMs with customer data to answer user queries. Our customers can use our dashboard to send or schedule single or bulk WhatsApp templates and manage end-to-end campaigns, including performance tracking.\n\nIn addition to WhatsApp, we offer chatbots on various other platforms such as websites, mobile apps, Messenger, and Instagram. All chats can be accessed and managed from our unified dashboard.",
